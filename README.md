# 🏓 go-build

This is an isolated version of the old `build` package I wrote for [Inertia](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/inertia), a command-line application that enables easy, self-hosted continuous deployment. It provides a Golang API for executing Dockerfile, docker-compose, and Herokuish builds and deployments.

This package is WIP and still depends on a number of Inertia packages.
